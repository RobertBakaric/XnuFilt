=======================

NAME:

XNU Filter


DESCRIPTION:


This is a C++ implementation of XNU filtering strategy proposed by Jean Michel Claverie 
and David J. States (1993), created for identifying and masking repetitive segments in 
amino acid sequences. 



SYNOPSIS:
    
    #include<string>
    #include<XNU.hpp>

    string ProtSeq = "VGRGVQIGSPHHHHHHHHHHPQPATYQTSGNLGVSYSHSSCGPSYGSQNFSAPYSPYALNQEADVSGGYPQCAPAVYSGNLSSPMVQHHHHHQGYAGGAVGSPQYIHHSYGQEHQSLALATYN";

/* Make object */

    /* Construction */
    XNU<int> Xnu;
    /*  OR  */
    XNU<int> Xnu(arg); // arg is : unordered_map<string, string>


/*  Functions */


    string mask = Xnu.Filter(ProtSeq);   
       //mask =   VGRGVQIGSPXXXXXXXXXXXXXATYQTSGNLGVSYSHSSCGPSYGSQNFSAPYSPYALNQEADVSGGYPQCAPAVYSGNLSSPMVXXXXXXXGYAGGAVGSPQYIHHSYGQEHQSLALATYN
